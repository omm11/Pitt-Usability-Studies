#Blog 1: What excites me?

Something that excites me is when a product is designed well. I am excited when I can easily use something and not be frustrated by its constraints. For example, the fan beside my bed is designed well. There are three settings (low, medium, high) and each setting is indicated by a blue light. Additionally, the higher the setting is, the louder the fan becomes. That said, there is never a question if the fan is on low or high. The feedback of whether or not the fan is working is immediate. As soon as I press the power button, I am never left to question if the product is working how it should. Another important factor of good design is longevity. I have had this fan for over ten years and it has yet to fail me. In my opinion, a product is designed well if the consumer can get significant use out of it.
