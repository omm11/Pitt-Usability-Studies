#Design that Excites: Amazon's Alexa

I've always appreciated a good design, even before I really knew what design was. I love when something is easy to use, I love when something is aesthetically pleasing, and I *especially* love when something is both.

One of the first things that came to my mind that fits both of those are the system design for Amazon Alexa. In my house, we have an ungodly amount of Echo shows, which are the kind with the screens, and Echo dots (*I’m talking one in every room.*) They really are just so well-designed. Their physical design is small and minimalistic, easy to put everywhere and anywhere. They’re easy to set up, they have an abundance of features that work with your individual needs, and are heavily customizable (*like when we had to change the name of ours to “Echo” because Alexa is far too close to Alexis*). It's easy enough for my eight-year old brother and great-grandparents to navigate, while still being useful for more tech-savvy people.

I still have so much to learn, but I think Amazon’s Echo is the kind of design that excites me. It finds the balance between a sleek, pleasant interface and functionality.
